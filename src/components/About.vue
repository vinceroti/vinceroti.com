    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a hard-working, positive, and supportive team member. Aside from
      those initial qualities, I strive in helping others achieve success to
      ultimately grow as a team. Iâ€™m also not afraid of trying new things and
      taking risks to fulfill goals, in order to create unique and beautiful
      things. Being able to share what I create with the world is the driving
      force that truly makes me so passionate about coding.
