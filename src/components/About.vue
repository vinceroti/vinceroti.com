    <h2>About Vince</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Vince Roti and I am hard-working, positive, and supportive team
      member. Aside from those initial qualities, I strive in helping others
      achieve success to ultimately grow as a team. Iâ€™m also not afraid of
      trying new things and taking risks to fulfill goals, in order to create
      unique and beautiful things. Being able to share what I create with the
      world is the driving force that truly makes me so passionate about coding.
      Recently, I graduated from Dev Bootcamp, which is a 19-week, intensive,
      Full Stack web development training program. With all of that being said,
      I am now currently looking for a new opportunity within the web
      development field, whether it's front-end or full stack development.
