    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I strive to help others achieve success to ultimately grow as a team. I'm
      always looking to try new things and am excited to learn emerging best
      practices, in order to create unique and engaging experiences. Being able
      to share what I create with the world is the driving force that truly
      makes me so passionate about coding.
